# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

## Step 2

1. 10 Critera of Open Source Software
    It's interesting to me how the critera say that authors may not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor, but what if your software starts being using for something you strongly oppose? Going even further, what if OSS was used as a part of a project for discrimination, which goes against criteria #5? I think it's interesting how 8 of the 10 criteria are about making sure everyone has access, 1 is about being unrestricted for all fields of endeavor, and only 1 is about how the license can't discriminate against anyone.

1. Eric Raymond - How To Ask Questions The Smart Way
    I understand that most people who answer questions about software on the internet are volunteering their time, but the condescending attitude and hostile demeanor is exactly why Linux still isn't a mainstream OS. It's really hard to learn sometimes and experienced users sometimes push you out. Some people simply don't have the time to spend hours digging in config settings and commands to get something to work just right so they can do their job or play their games. It's a real problem. That being said, the tips in the article are extremely useful. It's so, so important to take a look first, and when you ask say what you tried so people know you put a little effort in up front. Also Stack Overflow is a godsend.

    This article has a lot of really good tips on general internet etiquette. It puts so many things that bother me about questions on the internet (and in general) into discrete parts.

1. Suggestions for How To Ask Questions The Smart Way
    * If you figure out the solution, please, please reply to your question with it. It's the most painful thing when you find someone with your problem and the "answer" is just "nvm, I figured it out."
    * As an addendum to displaying the solutions you've tried, maybe also link to those questions, or other questions with people who have the same problem you do (but don't have answers yet). The extra information helps give better problem coverage and also filter out unimportant details.

1. Free Culture Chapter 3
    This is an article that involves a lot of pretty nuanced topics. For starters, there's a large argument surrounding whether platforms are responsible for the content hosted on them. If a drug dealer uses Twitter to make deals, is Twitter liable for enabling that? The general consensus is no, because it's impossible for Twitter to moderate all the content, and so they're generally considered a public forum. I believe Jesse's search engine should have fallen under the same definition. He didn't make the files publicly available, other people made them public on the network.

    The fact that the RIAA bullied him and 3 other students leads into another unsavory topic. The American legal system is biased towards larger organization and people with more money. Jesse definitely didn't cause the RIAA any sort of significant financial loss, but they wanted to come down hard on him so that they could keep control over the music industry and set examples for anyone else. They didn't care they might be delaying/destroying students lives and financial well-being, or that Jesse didn't make the network to be a pirate. And they were able to bully him because they had more money and better lawyers. The legal system is broken when someone can win because they have more money, and not because they were right.

    What I got out of that chapter is that the way we approached open software used to be very wrong (but has gotten a lot better), and that the American legal system is influence far too much by who has deeper pockets.

## Step 6 - Reflection

[VMAF](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf) could be an interesting open source project to evaluate.

One project that would interest me is making some kind of smart home system. Something using easily obtainable computers like Arduinos or Raspberry Pi's (and Pi Zeros) and sensors from suppliers to make simple sensors that could be integrated into a home server/website for a custom interface. For example, having multiple temperature sensors around the house to act as a thermostat with one controlling the heating/cooling. Some custom webcams to watch dogs, front doors and more.
