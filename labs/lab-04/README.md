# Lab 4 - Licensing

## Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
It's important to choose a license so the users of your software know what rights (and restrictions) they have. Licenses also give your software legal protection. Licensing your software also makes it more likely to be used and improved, because users and companies will have a clear understanding of what they can and can't do. If you don't include a license then the default copyright laws apply, meaning that others aren't allowed to reproduce, distribute, or create derivate works with your code.

## Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
You shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license because then the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you're not allowed to reproduce, distribute, or create derivate works with that project's code. It also means that your contributions and usage of that project don't have an open source license, so other people aren't allowed to reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works with your code either. Using a project that doesn't have an explicit license is less clear and much more restrictive, basically.

## Why the Web beat Gopher - Failure to follow the Open System Model
I mostly agree with the claim that the Web beat Gopher because they failed to follow the Open Systems Model. One of the their greatest mistakes was not taking feedback and reducing the barrier to allow other developers into their process. Because of this, more developers focused on HTML and the Web development. It's possible that they could have succeeded had they avoided alienating people with their line between commerical and education for licensing fees, or if they had been more open about taking criticism and suggestions. However, it seems that there was enough interest in the space that HTML/Web might have won out anyways because developers were willing to hop on the open development process and donate their time and expertise. They lost mind-share in the space due to these failures, and despite sounding like a good project, they lost out to more open, flexible projects.

## #6 - License Justifications
### Linux
The Linux Kernel is under the GPL v2 license because Linus Torvalds (the original creator of Linux) felt that Linux needed to be open to other developers in order to improve, and that those modifications needed to always be able to be brought back into the main codebase. Linus also strongly felt that Linux should always be available on the internet for free (free as in money) because as a student he was always annoyed about having to pay money for software like Minix.
